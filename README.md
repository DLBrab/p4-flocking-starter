Inspiration is schooling fish, particularly the smooth fluid motions, and the way the ball just kinda moves away magically from predators.

Title: Flowing Fishies
Description: Fish will swim around on their own. Directions state inputs that will influence the way they swim. Note that they do also respond to where your cursor is.

I couldn't really come close to what schooling fish do. It's so much prettier. My fish jitter like a cold person's jaw when theyre introduced to food, or when you convince them
to move a little too close to the edge. It's rough. I feel like a lot of the limitations involved with this were simply coming up with correct mathematical representations for the swirling motion that schooling fish do, and trying to keep them all in a ball.
